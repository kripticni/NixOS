# NixOS Production System (Deprecated)

Meant to be the all-stable system that will always  
work on boot and always allow me to do my work with  
no maintainance or upgrading.

This has been my production system for a long time,  
it has served well to learn a couple things but I  
decided to abandon it due to NixOS avoiding many of  
the common linux challenges I wished to face and  
generally the complexities of system management.

A part of my decision has also been influenced  
by the leading developers of NixOS and their  
behavior, in regards to many things.
